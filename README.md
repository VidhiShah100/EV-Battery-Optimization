# EV-Battery-Optimization
This report explores Electric Vehicle (EV) battery and charging station performance using eXtreme Gradient Boost (XG Boost). The approach used in this report is predicting the output power loss based on the state of charge of the battery system. The models was analysed using a 1kW 6 KWh operational Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) dataset under different operating conditions, such as current (45A and 50A) and flow rate (3,6,12 and 18 L/min). The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and ùëÖ score (coefficient of determination). A VRFB system is used owing majorly to its scalability, long life cycle and environmentally friendly characteristics.
