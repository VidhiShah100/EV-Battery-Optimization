# EV-Battery-Optimization
This repository explores EV battery &amp; charging station performance using XG Boost. The output power loss is predicted based on the state of charge of the battery system. An operational VRFB dataset under different operating conditions, such as current &amp; flow rate was fed to the model. It is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, RMSE &amp; 𝑅 score.
